## Introduction
**ResiReg** (**Res**idential **Reg**ulation) is a productivity app designed to help admin staff at Residential Colleges (RCs)* in NUS with their daily tasks. ResiReg allows admin to allocate rooms to students, manage students records, generate billing and OHS reports, and export CSVs for easy reference and sharing.
 
 **ResiReg** has the following main features:
 
 * Manage records of students.
 * Manage allocations of students to rooms in the College
 * Export records of students, rooms or transactions to CSV files for easy reference and sharing.

__ResiReg__ is optimised for OHS who are fast typists who are used to MS Excel, and prefer typing over other means of input. It comes with:
- A Command Line Interface (CLI) which allows you to access all __ResiReg__ features by typing.
- A Graphical User Interface (GUI) that displays the information you need in a grid format.

> __ResiReg__ is currently a work in progress. Here is a low-fidelity mockup of its skeleton. Stay tuned for our progress!

This section explains the format of commands in this User Guide.

- Words in `<angular_brackets>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `deallocate <student_name>`, `<student_name>` is a parameter which can be used as `deallocate Jet New`.
- Items in square brackets are optional e.g `<full_name> [-aka <alias>]` can be used as `Jet New -aka JJ` or as `Jet New`.
- Items with … after them can be used multiple times including zero times, unless otherwise stated e.g. `[/m <mod> /ig <interest_group>]…` can be used as `/m mod /ig ig`, `/m mod1 /ig ig1 /m mod2 /ig ig2` etc.

* The room at `room_index` must currently be vacant. Otherwise, an error message is displayed accordingly. 

Examples:
* `reallocate si/1 ri/2` first deallocates the room currently allocated to student with index 1, then  allocates the room at index 2 to the student.

Examples:
* `add  n/Jet New i/E0407889 p/82462157 e/jn@u.nus.edu f/SOC` successfully creates a new student named Jet New whose student ID is E0407889, phone number is 82462157,
email is jn@u.nus.edu, and faculty is Computing (SOC). 
* `add student n/Jet New i/E0407889 e/jn@u.nus.edu` prompts the user with the following error message (because the faculty field is missing):
