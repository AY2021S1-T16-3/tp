## Introduction
**ResiReg** (**Res**idential **Reg**ulation) is a productivity app designed to help admin staff at Residential Colleges (RCs)* in NUS with their daily tasks. ResiReg allows admin to allocate rooms to students, manage students records, generate billing and OHS reports, and export CSVs for easy reference and sharing.
 
 **ResiReg** has the following main features:
 
 * Manage records of students.
 * Manage allocations of students to rooms in the College
 * Generate bills and log payments for RC-related services.
 * Export records of students, rooms or transactions to CSV files for easy reference and sharing.

__ResiReg__ is optimised for OHS who are fast typists who are used to MS Excel, and prefer typing over other means of input. It comes with:
- A Command Line Interface (CLI) which allows you to access all __ResiReg__ features by typing.
- A Graphical User Interface (GUI) that displays the information you need in a grid format.

> __ResiReg__ is currently a work in progress. Here is a low-fidelity mockup of its skeleton. Stay tuned for our progress!
